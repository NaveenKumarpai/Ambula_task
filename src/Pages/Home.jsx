        Introduction to Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs)
        </h2>
        <p>
        Simply put, an ambulatory surgery center (ASC) is a healthcare facility in which medical procedures, oftentimes surgical in nature, that do not require an overnight patient stay take place. ASCs are usually either freestanding medical facilities or part of larger healthcare organizations. These centers offer patients several advantages over traditional hospital-based surgical procedures, including shorter wait times, lower costs, and smaller chances of infectious disease exposure.
